## What is This?

***ShmupArch*** is a repackaged version of RetroArch created by Mark_MSX from [The Electric Underground](https://www.youtube.com/@TheElectricUnderground) incorporating a lot of settings for RetroArch, the FBNeo core and ROM specifics to make Shmupping as good and responsive as possible. Read the below article for a more detailed reasoning from Mark.
